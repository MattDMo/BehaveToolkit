# Welcome to BehaveToolkit

BehaveToolkit provides integration between Sublime Text 3 and Behave.

# Setup

BehaveToolkit requires `behave` to be installed. If you haven't already, you can
install it using `pip`.

```

$ pip install behave

```

If you're installing inside a virtualenv, you need to update the
"python_interpreter" setting in your project file.

```

{
  "settings":
  {
    "python_interpreter": "/path/to/virtualenv/bin/python"
  }
}

```

You can now start using BehaveToolkit by opening your command palette
[Super + Shift + P]([Ctrl + Shift + P] on Windows), typing `Behave` and
selecting the action you want to do.

Certain actions can only be done when certain files are open. (e.g. "Go to step
definition" only shows up when you have a feature file open.)
