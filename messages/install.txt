# Welcome to BehaveToolkit

BehaveToolkit provides integration between Sublime Text 3 and Behave.

## Setup

BehaveToolkit requires `behave` to be installed. If you haven't already, you
can install it using `pip`.

```

$ pip install behave

```

By default, behave will be launched using the value returned by `which behave`.
If you want to modify the way behave gets launched (if you're using a
virtualenv, for example), you need to update the "behave_command" setting in
your project file.

```

{
  "settings":
  {
    "behave_command": ["/path/to/virtualenv/bin/behave"]
  }
}

```

You can now start using BehaveToolkit by opening your command palette, typing
`Behave` and selecting the action you want to do. Certain actions can only be
done when certain files are open. (e.g. "Go to step definition" only shows up
when you have a feature file open.)
