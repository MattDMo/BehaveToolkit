Troubleshooting
===============

One of the popular reasons for ``BehaveToolkit`` not working is ``behave`` not
working. A good rule of thumb is that, if ``behave`` works, then
``BehaveToolkit`` should work.

**Project root directory**

Sublime should be opened with the directory where you would run behave. If you
followed the :doc:`gettingstarted` guide, you would notice that we opened
Sublime on the ``myproject/`` folder. This is also the directory where we would
run ``behave``. Sure enough, if we run ``behave`` in this folder, it will work.

**Behave can't be found**

There may be instances where the ``behave`` binary cannot be found on your
system. In which case, you should look at :doc:`configuration`.

**Other issues**

If you're still having problems, don't hesitate to ask questions by opening an
issue on our `GitHub issues page`_.
