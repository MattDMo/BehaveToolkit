Other things to note:

- We're using PEP8 as our code style guide.
- Keep your code well documented. All classes and methods should have docstrings (unless it's painfully obvious what it does).

## Bugs

If you run into bugs, please report them at the repo's [issue tracker](https://github.com/mixxorz/BehaveToolkit/issues) if an issue hasn't already been created for that bug.

It will help if you include the following info in your report

* Sublime Text version number
* Behave version number
* Console error output
* A description of the problem.
* Steps to reproduce, if possible.

Thanks :grinning:
